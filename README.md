The Bike Rental dataset records bike-sharing demand based on seasonal, temporal, and weather-related factors. It includes variables like season, month, weekday, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, with the target variable being rental count. The data initially contained 17 columns and 17,379 hourly records, which were preprocessed by removing irrelevant features, converting to daily data, and handling outliers, reducing it to 731 rows and 15 columns. This preprocessing ensured a more reliable dataset for modeling.

The objective of this project is to predict daily bike rental demand using machine learning models by analyzing environmental and seasonal factors. Several models were tested, with Gradient Boosting performing the best (RMSE ≈ 598.78, R² ≈ 0.90), followed by Random Forest and XGBoost, while SVR performed poorly (negative R²). To prevent data leakage, ‘casual’ and ‘registered’ users were excluded, and the final model was trained using 11 key features, ensuring improved accuracy and generalizability.

The final implementation includes a custom user input system for real-time rental predictions and visualizations of Actual vs. Predicted values to assess model accuracy. The Gradient Boosting model is the most reliable, helping bike-sharing companies optimize fleet management and forecast demand based on weather and seasonality. This predictive approach enhances resource allocation, user experience, and operational efficiency in bike-sharing services.
